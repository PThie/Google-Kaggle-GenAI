Erich Honecker dictated to the Daily Mirror for the Pan-European Picnic: \"Habsburg distributed leaflets far into Poland, on which the East German holidaymakers were invited to a picnic. When they came to the picnic, they were given gifts, food and Deutsche Mark, and then they were persuaded to come to the West.\" The leadership of the GDR in East Berlin did not dare to completely block the borders of their own country and the USSR did not respond at all.

We cannot allow oppression defined and justified by religion or tribe to replace that of [communist] ideology.\"\\nCelebrations will centre around the Brandenburg Gate, which has become the symbol of German reunification since the peaceful revolution that opened up the Wall in 1989. Much of the Wall has since been demolished, although a section of the 155 kilometre (96 mile) long wall remains serving as an art gallery for graffiti artists.\\nHost German Chancellor Angela Merkel reminisced that the end of the Cold War came as a total surprise. \"The 20th anniversary of the fall of the Wall should remind us all what incredible luck we had with the reunification of Europe and Germany,\" commented Merkel, who grew up in communist East Germany, in Monday\\'s edition of the Bild newspaper.\\nOther leaders expected to attend are Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, along with former Polish President Lech Wałęsa, once leader of the Solidarity trade union and former Hungarian Prime Minister Miklós Németh, who decided to open his country\\'s borders, both who were key players in the downfall of communism in Europe.\\nBerlin\\'s Mayor Klaus Wowereit summed up the feeling of the people. \"History is palpable and alive here,\" he said. \"The peaceful revolution of the fall of the Wall 20 years ago paved the way to an unprecedented transformation of Berlin.\"\\n\\n\\n== Sources ==\\n \"Berlin celebrates demise of Wall\" — BBC News Online, November 9, 2009\\nAgence France Presse. \"World leaders gather to mark fall of Berlin Wall\" — France 24, November 9, 2009\\n \"Wall anniversary celebrations kick off in Berlin\" — Agence France-Presse, November 9, 2009'}, {'title': 'Czechs and Slovaks celebrate twenty years since Velvet Revolution', 'content': 'Wednesday, November 18, 2009 \\nCzechs and Slovaks yesterday celebrated the twenty-year anniversary of the so-called \"Velvet Revolution\", which brought down the then Czechoslovakian Communist regime, with thousands re-enacting the demonstration that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall, and elections in Poland and Hungary.\\nDavid Gaydecka, one of the organisers, was thirteen when he went with his father to participate in the demonstration. \"I didn\\'t really understand what was happening, but I could sense something in  the air. I knew this was something important,\" he said. \"The Wall had come down in Berlin, they were holding elections in Poland and  Hungary. Everyone knew that it would come here too, but nobody knew how to  do it. It was embarrassing for the Czechs; we were almost the last ones.\"\\nFormer dissident and playwright Václav Havel, who went on to become President of Czechoslovakia (and first president of the Czech Republic) joined 5,000 students, past and present, who retraced the march. Originally officials had sanctioned the march, but groups splintered away in an attempt to reach Wenceslas Square. The Communist leaders ordered riot police to seal off streets, leading to beatings and two hundred people injured.\\nThis was to prove the government\\'s downfall with anger throughout the country motivating opposition and the old regime broke down shortly afterwards. \"The atmosphere that day was terrible, like a war,\" Michael Kocáb, Czech Minister for Human Rights and Minorities, who played a major role in the transition from a totalitarian regime to democracy. \"I was just a few yards away when I saw the police beating  people. It was the first time that the police did not leave an escape route  for us.

Schröder was the first to congratulate her before she accepted the election. The newly formed grand coalition of Social (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) holds a total of 448 seats in the Bundestag.\\nLater in the day, Merkel took the oath of office and president Horst Köhler officially appointed her along with her cabinet.\\nAngela Merkel was born 1954 in Hamburg. After her birth her father was offered a pastorship in East Germany (GDR) and the family moved there. She studied physics in Leipzig where she earned her PhD. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Merkel became involved in the East German democracy movement, joining the Demokratischer Aufbruch. She was spokeswoman of the first and last freely elected prime minister of the GDR, Lothar de Maizière. After the reunification Merkel served as minister of youth and family in the government of Helmut Kohl during the years 1990 – 1994 and later as minister of the environment from 1994 – 1998. In 2000 she became head of the Christian Democrats and in the following Federal election of 2002 she stood aside, letting Edmund Stoiber of the Bavarian CSU be the failed Christian Democrats candidate for the chancellorship.  When Gerhard Schröder called for an early election in May of this year, Merkel received the nomination of her party.\\nOutgoing Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, was born during 1944 in Blomberg. His father died in World War II, only a few months after Schröder\\'s birth. He initially worked as a sales clerk and earned his high school diploma studying at night. He studied law in Göttingen and worked at the University there, joining the Social Democrats and became chair of the Young Socialists, the youth organisation of the party. In 1980 he was elected to the Bundestag and later became governor of Lower-Saxony. In 1998 he was the SPD\\'s successful candidate for chancellor, forming a coalition government with The Greens. After the resignation of Oskar Lafontaine in 1999, Schröder also became chair of the SPD, a post he held until 2004.

His death, announced by the BBC on Monday morning, came just a few months after he was diagnosed with cancer.\\nDuring his career with the BBC, Hanrahan had travelled almost the whole of the world, covering such news events as the assassination of the Indian Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the massacre by Chinese troops in Tienanmen Square, Beijing, and the coming to power of Mikhail Gorbachev and the subsequent rise of the \"Glasnost\" era in Russia.\\nBut it is for his coverage of the Falklands War that Hanrahan will be best remembered, and his famous quote while on board an aircraft carrier, watching Harrier Jump Jets taking off and landing, that he \"counted them all out, and I counted them all back.\"\\nIn 2001, Hanrahan travelled to the United States to anchor a series of special programmes concerning the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre.\\nHanrahan also covered some of the more sombre events in recent British history, providing commentary and coverage with BBC News of the deaths and subsequent funerals of both Diana Princess of Wales, and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.\\nCommenting upon the news, BBC Director General Mark Thompson said: \"Brian was a journalist of unimpeachable integrity and outstanding judgement, but his personal kindness and humanity also came through. That is why audiences and everyone who knew him here will miss him very much.\" \\nThe Deputy Director General of Journalism at the BBC, Mark Byford, described Hanrahan as \"one of the BBC\\'s greatest journalists\", adding: \"His work covering the Falklands War produced some of the most memorable war reporting of the last 50 years. His great craft of using words sparingly but powerfully is a lasting memory for me. A beautiful writer, a beautiful man, whose passion for the BBC and for high standards in journalism inspired us all.

Last weekend, Veja reported that Partido dos Trabalhadores (or PT), the Brazilian ruling party and the party of president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, received 5 million dollars from FARC in its 2002 political campaign. The magazine used documents gotten from Abin itself as a source in their reporting.\\nFelix testified before a commission of deputies and senators to explain the allegations published by Veja. His statements make the possibility of a congressional investigation commission, as suggested by the deputy Alberto Fraga (PTB), unlikely. The leader of the government, Aloísio Mercadante, said PT will prosecute Fraga for defamation and that he considers the case finished.\\nThe official Abin version is stated on its website.  The agency stores and archives all data collected by the intelligence service. Even data that does not fulfill all the Abin criterion for consistency and veracity remain in the Abin archive so they can be re-evaluated in the future.  According to Felix, Abin archives may contain data that are not relevant, tendentious or even completely untrue.  The documents mentioned by the magazine Veja are a kind of this material. Since Abin cannot guarantee the veracity of these data, they should not be reported.\\nThe general didn\\'t say whether or not Abin confirmed the meeting between FARC delegates and PT members as stated in the documents. \"I can\\'t speak about that in front of the press\", he added, explaining that the documents are a state secret.\\nThe magazine Veja was very cautious when it reported the story. The article says that they did not find solid evidence to prove that PT received money from FARC.  Veja investigated the facts described in the documents and admitted the donation could be untrue: \\n\\n(...) Veja located the agent who infiltrated in the FARC meeting and it talked to two other employees from the agency [Abin], besides of looking for the left members who participated of the enconteur. The [magazine\\'s] investigation confirmed the meeting, the place, the date and the persons. It only didn\\'t find evidences to proof that the money went from the FARC to  PT safes.(..) Could it be just a swagger of father Oliverio Medina(...) to appraise his left hosts? Yes, it could.  —Veja , \"FARC\\'s tentacles in Brazil\", March 16, 2005, page 46.\\nAlthough they found no solid proof relating the money transaction, and although the magazine considered the Abin\\'s documents might be untrue, Veja said the documents were consistent enough to be sent to the President: \\n\\n(...)[the documents] are known by their errors and mistakes motivated usually by a anti-communist paranoia(...)The documents reporting the transaction which the FARC promised help to left-wing candidates in Brazil are not free or errors neither. The papers way thought the hierarchy of the intelligence service suggests that the information originated from a experienced spy who is trusted by his superiors. The documents show that their informations have been hard checked. (...) The document 0095/3100 of April 25, 2002, the main one which reports the liaisons between PT and FARC members, has passed thought all the phases and it finished with a Top Secret stamp. That means that its informations had credibility and its contents were enough consistent so it could be sent to the President. —Veja , \"FARC\\'s tentacles in Brazil\", March 16, 2005, page 49.\\nSome deputies demand further investigations of alleged FARC activities in Brazil.\\nThe Brazilian Deputy Arthur Virgílio (PSDB) said: \"These investigations cannot stop... I give to PT the benefit of doubt as an institution. However the ideologic political relationship is evident.\" [1] The Brazilian Deputy Antero Paes de Barros (PSDB) said:  \"There must be more clarifications because the State interest is high in this case\". \\nThe FARC and PT are part of the Foro de São Paulo organization created by Cuban President Fidel Castro and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to discuss new strategies for the left in Latin America after the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe.\\nPT admits that some of its members have met FARC members in the past, but maintains the FARC donation are untrue. The party said if evidence showing its members received money from the FARC was found, that member would be expelled from the party. They also said if a donation occurred, it would be confirmed by the Brazilian Central Bank\\'s records, and it has not. PT believes the alleged party relationship with FARC is being used by the political opposition in negative propaganda. \\nAccording to the president of the Joint Congressional Commission for the Control of Intelligence Activities, Senator Cristovam Buarque (PT-DF) the investigation is finished. The senator said that the accusation of the alleged donation of 5 million dollars to the PT was a sad\\nepisode because it affected a party\\'s  credibility without anybody seeing any proof.\\n\\n\\n== Understanding the case ==\\n\\n\\n== Related news ==\\n\"Brazilian President party received money from FARC, say documents\" — Wikinews, March 15, 2005\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nPolicarpo Junior. \"Os tentáculos das FARC no Brasil - As explosivas ligações de petistas com as Farc\" — Veja, March 16, 2005\\n\\n\\n== Sources ==\\nGabriela Guerreiro,David Silberstein. \"Commission considers case closed on alleged FARC donation to PT\" — Radiobras, March 18, 2005\\nIolando Lourenço, David Silberstein. \"Leaders rebut accusations of alleged ties between PT and FARC\" — Radiobras, March 15, 2005\\n \"Brazil dismisses Colombia rebel cash report\" — Reuters, March 18, 2005\\nVasconcelo Quadros. \"Abin descarta envolvimento entre Farc e PT\" — O Estado de São Paulo, March 17, 2005\\n \"Registros do BC desmentem ligação do PT com Farc\" — Terra, March 15, 2005'}]\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":28},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 1: Implementation of Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) - Generate thoughts (using background)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This steps generates n ideas (default: n = 3) about the event and scenario based on the background information.

The user provided a bunch of background information, so I need to extract the key points and imagine different directions.\n\nFirst, I should understand the historical event: the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, leading to German reunification and the end of the Cold War. The counterfactual is that the wall didn't fall, so I need to explore what that would mean.\n\nThe user wants three distinct outlines, each with a title and a 1-2 sentence content.

NATO and Warsaw Pact might remain, and European unity could be affected. Global hotspots might persist without a shift in superpower dynamics.\n\n2. **Technological and Cultural Stagnation**: Without German reunification, technological collaboration might not happen, leading to slower progress. Cultural exchange could also be stifled, affecting media, arts, etc.\n\n3. **Economic Impact**: Divided Germany could lead to continued economic disparities. The absence of a unified market might slow global economic growth and hinder international trade.\n\nI need to make sure each outline is distinct and covers a different aspect.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at Thought 1: \"A Divided World: The Persistence of the Cold War.\" The content suggests that if the Berlin Wall hadn't fallen, the Cold War would have continued, leading to ongoing division between East and West, prolonged tensions, and a different global politics trajectory. This seems pretty plausible because the Berlin Wall was a significant symbol of the Cold War, and its fall marked a turning point. The idea that the Cold War would have continued makes sense, so plausibility is high. Creativity-wise, it's a classic alternate history scenario, which is common but still relevant. The potential impact is also considerable because it affects global politics, which is a big area. So, I think this is strong but maybe a bit on the common side.\n\nNext, Thought 2: \"Stagnation and Isolation.\" It talks about technological and cultural advancements being hindered due to continued isolation. This is also plausible because isolation often hinders progress. However, I'm wondering how specific this is. It mentions technological and cultural advancements but doesn't give examples or specific areas, which might make it a bit vague. Creativity-wise, it's a good angle but maybe not as unique as others. Potential impact is there, but without specifics, it might not stand out as much. So, it's good but could be better with more details.\n\nLastly, Thought 3: \"Economic Disparities and Global Trade.\" This one focuses on economic disparities and the effect on global trade and market integration. Economically, this makes sense because the division would likely affect trade patterns and economic policies. It's plausible and the impact on global markets is significant. However, the creativity here is a bit lower because economic impacts are a common topic in historical what-ifs. It's still a solid point but maybe not as fresh as others.\n\nNow, ranking them. Thought 1 has high plausibility and impact but is a bit common. Thought 3 is also plausible and impactful but perhaps less creative. Thought 2 is good but lacks specifics. So, I think Thought 1 is the best because it's the most comprehensive, even if it's a common topic. Thought 3 is next because it's specific to economics, which is important. Thought 2 is last because it's a bit too vague, though still a valid point.\n\nWait, but in the example, the evaluation considered creativity, plausibility, and impact. Maybe I should adjust. Thought 1 is strong in plausibility and impact, but maybe not the most creative. Thought 3 is specific, which is good for impact but maybe less creative. Thought 2 is more about the human aspect, which could be more engaging but lacks specifics. Hmm, perhaps Thought 1 is best, then Thought 3, then Thought 2. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"thought_id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"A Divided World: The Persistence of the Cold War\",\n        \"content\": \"If the Berlin Wall had never fallen, the Cold War might have endured, with continued division between East and West, prolonged geopolitical tensions, and a different trajectory for global politics.\",\n        \"evaluation\": \"This thought presents a plausible and impactful scenario, exploring the continuation of the Cold War.
